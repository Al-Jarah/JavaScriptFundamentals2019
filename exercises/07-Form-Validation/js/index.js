/**
 * As a engineer, I would like to have my form validated so the information is safe and correct.
*  
*  All the fields should be required!!

*  If a field is left empty on form submission, 
*  the form will display a red box indicating to the user that there has been an error.
*  
*  If the form is valid, the form should submit, and the user should see a confirmation of information they filled out. (Developers Discretion)


* Bonus Points
*  1) In addition to adding a class when a field is not valid display a message requesting the user to enter their information. 
*  2) Create a button that resets the form. 


* Developer notes
*  1) An error class named .error you can use to apply the proper css to an invalid element.
*  2) You can edit this form however you see fit as the engineer to achieve your goals. (i.e add ids or additional classes if needed)
